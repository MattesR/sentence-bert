# Repository for comparision of embedding-based and term-based similarity Search

As of now, elasticsearch is used for term-based similarity search. Documents(mails in this first case) are store as Documents, containing inner documents for text units.  
faiss is used as an index in order to store the embeddings of text units.

## Installed packages 
I've create a [handy Gist](https://gist.github.com/MattesR/ecb4c338bbf7b9975b025217e09e1a97) 
in order to make it easier to install all necessary packages for the project on a new machine.
